;; Dependencies.
;;
;; Context: weblocks used to be very limited as to what dependencies can
;; be specified. I've been reworking this a number of times in order to
;; fit various new requirements and finally decided that it is time to
;; redesign dependency tracking completely.
;;
;; Rationale: we need to be able to gather various kinds of dependencies
;; from renderable objects (widgets, views, presentations). Dependencies
;; are local (to our webserver) or external (external URLs), stylesheet
;; or javascript code, and some could be introduced during AJAX page
;; updates. We need to be able to handle all of these, where handling
;; means: gather, compare and remove duplicates, detect new
;; dependencies, render (possibly generating code that calls back
;; javascript callbacks after updates have been completed).
;;
;; It looks complex, because the problem domain is complex. There is no
;; escape from that. Fortunately, all that complexity will be hidden
;; behind the scenes. Most people will only need to define one method
;; for their new widget and that method will simply return one dependency.
